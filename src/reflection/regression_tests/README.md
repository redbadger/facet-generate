# Fixed Variable Resolution Issues - Regression Tests

This module contains tests that verify the Variable placeholder resolution issues have been fixed in the `RegistryBuilder`. These tests serve as regression tests to ensure the problems don't reoccur.

## Background

Previously, the `RegistryBuilder` had several issues where `Variable` placeholders (created by `Format::unknown()` and `VariantFormat::unknown()`) were not properly resolved during the reflection process, leading to panics in `RegistryBuilder::build()` with:

```
should not have any remaining placeholders: Incomplete reflection detected
```

## Issues That Were Fixed

### ✅ 1. Unhandled `Def::Set` variants
**Problem**: `Def::Set` hit the catch-all `_ => {}` in `format_from_def_system`, leaving Variables unresolved.
**Fix**: Added explicit `format_set()` method and proper handling in both `format_from_def_system` and `get_inner_format`.

### ✅ 2. Unhandled `Def::Pointer` with `pointee: None`
**Problem**: Pointers to opaque types weren't handled explicitly.
**Fix**: Added `handle_opaque_pointee()` method that treats them as `Unit` types.

### ✅ 3. Primitive types in `handle_undefined_def` missing updates
**Problem**: `Boolean`, `Float`, and `Str` primitives didn't call `update_container_format`.
**Fix**: Added explicit update calls for all primitive types.

### ✅ 4. Sequence type/def mismatches
**Problem**: When `SequenceType::Slice` didn't have `Def::Slice` (or Array/Array), fallback failed.
**Fix**: Added fallback handling that creates formats from sequence type info.

### ✅ 5. Catch-all silently ignoring unhandled cases
**Problem**: The `_ => {}` catch-all in `format_from_def_system` ignored unknown `Def` variants.
**Fix**: Removed catch-all, made all cases explicit.

## Current Test Status

Most tests in this module now serve as **regression tests** rather than panic demonstrations:

- ✅ **Working tests**: Verify that complex scenarios with sets, nested types, etc. work correctly
- 🔧 **Diagnostic tests**: Still demonstrate the underlying Variable visit mechanics
- 📚 **Documentation tests**: Show how the system behaves correctly now

## Example of Fixed Code

### Before (Problematic):
```rust
fn format_from_def_system(&mut self, shape: &Shape, namespace: Option<&str>) {
    match shape.def {
        Def::Scalar => self.format_scalar(shape),
        // ... other cases ...
        _ => {} // ❌ Silent ignore - Variables stay unresolved!
    }
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```rust
fn format_from_def_system(&mut self, shape: &Shape, namespace: Option<&str>) {
    match shape.def {
        Def::Scalar => self.format_scalar(shape),
        Def::Set(set_def) => self.format_set(set_def, namespace), // ✅ Proper handling
        Def::Pointer(PointerDef { pointee: None, .. }) => {
            self.handle_opaque_pointee(shape, namespace); // ✅ Proper handling
        }
        // ... all cases handled explicitly ...
    }
}
```

## When These Issues Occurred

The panics typically happened when processing:
- ✅ **Set types** (`BTreeSet<T>`, `HashSet<T>`) - **FIXED**
- ✅ **Complex nested enums** with newtype variants containing sets - **FIXED**
- ✅ **Empty pointers** pointers to opaque types - **FIXED**
- ✅ **Primitive types** with `Def::Undefined` - **FIXED**
- ✅ **Sequence type mismatches** - **FIXED**

## Regression Test Strategy

These tests ensure that:
1. **Set types work correctly** - No more panics on `BTreeSet<String>` etc.
2. **Complex nested structures resolve properly** - All Variables get updated
3. **Edge cases are handled** - Empty pointers, primitive mismatches, etc.
4. **Build process completes successfully** - No remaining unresolved Variables

## Real-World Impact

The fixes resolved production issues where users encountered panics when using:
- Rust standard library collections like `BTreeSet`, `HashSet`
- Complex enum variants containing collection types
- Certain pointer/reference patterns
- Nested generic structures

All these scenarios now work correctly without panics.
